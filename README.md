## ABOUT ME
  Hello, I'm Ashley! I'm a developer and creative technologist interested in data analytics, cybersecurity and web-based projects.
I am currently a senior attending Columbia College of Missouri and I am three classes away from earning my Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems.
It's been a wild four years but I'm glad that I am finally finding my footing in programming! 
I have learned or am continuing learning in the following programming languages, skills and frameworks: 
1. C#
2. SQL
3. Web apps with MVC
4. Bootstrap
5. PHP
6. React.js
7. Javascript
8. Python
9. Data visualization
I also love art (digital and traditional)! I have always loved animation, drawing, painting and visual development. 
Thank you for visiting my side of the internet!
